# NASA Asteroid Data Analysis

This project analyzes near-Earth asteroid data from a NASA-provided CSV file. It includes data filtering, statistical analysis, and visualization to help understand the characteristics and behaviors of asteroids that have approached Earth.



## Features

- **CSV Data Loader**: Validates and loads asteroid data from a `.csv` file.
- **Data Filtering**: Filters asteroids by close approach year (from 2000 onwards).
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes irrelevant columns and provides dataset structure details.
- **Insights & Analysis**:
  - Finds the asteroid with the highest **absolute magnitude**.
  - Identifies the asteroid that came **closest to Earth**.
  - Counts **common orbit IDs**.
  - Determines how many asteroids have a **maximum diameter above the average**.
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Histogram** of average asteroid diameters.

  - **Histogram** of minimum orbit intersections.

  - **Pie Chart** of hazardous vs. non-hazardous asteroids.

  - **Scatter Plot with Linear Regression**: Between miss distance and speed.

## Input

The input is a CSV file with asteroid data. Make sure your file:
- Has a `.csv` extension.
- Includes fields like: `Name`, `Close Approach Date`, `Absolute Magnitude`, `Hazardous`, `Miss Dist.(kilometers)`, `Est Dia in KM(min)`, `Est Dia in KM(max)`, `Orbit ID`, etc.
- Is in the same folder as your .py file

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `os`(standard library)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
````

## How to Use

1. Place your asteroid data file in the same directory (e.g. `nasa.csv`).
2. Run the script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## Notes

* The project uses basic error handling for file validation.
* Statistical significance in linear regression is checked using `p-value`.

## Example Output

* Histogram of average asteroid diameters
* Pie chart of hazardous vs non-hazardous asteroids
* Scatter plot showing regression between miss distance and speed
